The simple shell project is a programming assignment that involves creating a basic command-line shell in the C programming language. The shell provides a simple user interface to execute various system commands such as ls, cd, mkdir, rm, etc.

The shell project requires the implementation of a parser that reads user input and identifies commands and arguments. It also needs to create child processes to execute the commands and manage input/output redirection, pipelines, and background processes.

The shell should provide a prompt to the user, read input from the command line, parse it into commands and arguments, execute the commands, and display the output to the user.

The simple shell project provides an opportunity to gain a deeper understanding of how the operating system manages processes and how shell commands are executed. Additionally, it provides experience in C programming, system calls, and command-line interface design.
